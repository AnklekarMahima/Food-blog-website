Food blog website
This is a dynamic food blogging platform built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS, designed for food lovers to share their culinary experiences and recipes. Users can create, view, edit, and delete blog posts with a focus on responsive design and smooth user interaction. The project includes:

Post creation and editing: Users can easily create new posts or update existing ones.
Image uploads: Share your delicious meals with consistent image sizes.
Clickable post cards: Each post is fully clickable for a seamless user experience.
Responsive design: The website is styled for optimal viewing across all devices.
Styling is implemented using CSS, and the layout focuses on readability and engagement. Note that this version does not include database functionality, so posts do not persist between sessions.
